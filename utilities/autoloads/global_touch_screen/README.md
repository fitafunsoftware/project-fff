# GlobalTouchScreen
Autoload to handle touch screen settings and loading.

The virtual joypad is added as a child of the MainGame, thus the code for adding the joypad is there, but other nodes should go through this autoload instead. This autoload will eventually also be used for saving and loading touch screen configurations from file.
