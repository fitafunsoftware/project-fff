# Hitbox Visualizer
A set of helper nodes to create visuals for hitboxes. The current visualization method is generating
an area on the ground to show a hitbox is active in that area. Each Visualizer is connected to the
monitoring property of a Hitbox and is only visible when the corresponding Hitbox is active.

## HitboxVisualizerManager
The main node you interact with to create the HitboxVisualizers.
